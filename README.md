# Lazy Bot 3.0

Lazy Bot is a multifunctional, fun, and interactive Discord bot designed to enhance user engagement within your server. Originally created in June 2020 by Conan for **Akashic Scans** (later renamed **Lazy Scans**), Lazy Bot quickly gained popularity for its variety of fun commands and useful moderation features. After a long hiatus, Lazy Bot was revamped in 2023 by Aadi into **Lazy Bot 2.0**, offering a more feature-rich and user-friendly experience.

The bot serves multiple purposes, from uplifting the mood of the community, tracking actions like hugs and respect, to providing mini-games such as Rock, Paper, Scissors. It also aids server management with birthday tracking, and even helps with decision-making using AI-powered responses.
